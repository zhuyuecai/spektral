class Loader:
    """
    Parent class for data loaders. The role of a Loader is to iterate over a
    Dataset and yield batches of graphs to feed your Keras Models.

    This is achieved by having a generator object that produces lists of Graphs,
    which are then collated together and returned as Tensor-like objects.

    The core of a Loader is the `collate(batch)` method.
    This takes as input a list of Graphs and returns a list of Tensors or
    SparseTensors.

    For instance, if all graphs have the same number of nodes and size of the
    attributes, a simple collation function can be:

    ```python
    def collate(self, batch):
        x = np.array([g.x for g in batch])
        a = np.array([g.a for g in batch)]
        return x, a
    ```

    The `load()` method of a Loader returns an object that can be given as
    input to `Model.fit()`.
    You can use it as follows:

    ```python
    model.fit(loader.load(), steps_per_epoch=loader.steps_per_epoch)
    ```

    The `steps_per_epoch` property represents the number of batches that are in
    an epoch, and is a required keyword when calling `model.fit()` with a Loader.

    If you want to write your own training function, you can use the
    `tf_signature()` method to specify the signature of your batches using the
    tf.TypeSpec system, in order to avoid unnecessary re-tracings.

    For example, a simple training function can be written as:

    ```python
    @tf.function(input_signature=loader.tf_signature())
    def train_step(inputs, target):
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            predictions = model(inputs, training=True)
            loss = loss_fn(target, predictions) + sum(model.losses)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        opt.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    ```

    We can then train our model in a for loop as follows:

    ```python
    for batch in loader:
        train_step(*batch)
    ```

    **Arguments**

    - `batch_size`: size of the mini-batches;
    - `epochs`: number of epochs to iterate over the dataset. By default (`None`)

    This loader returns batches of graphs stacked along an extra dimension,

    If `n_max` is the number of nodes of the biggest graph in the batch, then
    the padding consist of adding zeros to the node features, adjacency matrix,
    and edge attributes of each graph so that they have shapes
    `(n_max, n_node_features)`, `(n_max, n_max)`, and
    `(n_max, n_max, n_edge_features)` respectively.

    The zero-padding is done batch-wise, which saves up memory at the cost of
    more computation. If latency is an issue but memory isn't, or if the
    dataset has graphs with a similar number of nodes, you can use
    the `PackedBatchLoader` that first zero-pads all the dataset and then
    iterates over it.

    Note that the adjacency matrix and edge attributes are returned as dense
    arrays (mostly due to the lack of support for sparse tensor operations for

class SingleDynamicLoader(Loader):
    """
    A Loader for dynamic graph in 

    This loader produces Tensors representing a span of snapshots defined by the total snapshots and window length as
    well as the label y in a predefined number of snapshots later.
    As such, it can only be used with dynamic graph dataset which has a get_snapshots method implemented and the
    'batch_size' cannot be set.

    The loader supports sample weights through the `sample_weights` argument.
    If given, then each batch will be a tuple `(inputs, labels, sample_weights)`.

    shuffle is not supported in dynamic graph, the time sequence must be rendered by the order defined by the timestamps

    **Arguments**

    - `dataset`: a dynamic graph Dataset;
    - `window` : the lenght of the span
    - `positional`: true or false, if false, the snapshot is generated by duration length
    - `future_to_skip`: an integer t, the label for training would be or evaluation would the label in t snapshots
    - `epochs`: number of epochs to iterate over the dataset. By default (`None`)
    iterates indefinitely;
    - `sample_weights`: if given, these will be appended to the output
    automatically.

    **Output**

    Returns a tuple `(inputs, labels)` or `(inputs, labels, sample_weights)`.

    `inputs` is a tuple containing the data matrices of the graph, only if they
    are not `None`:

    - `x`: a ndarray of L snapshots' x, with shape  H * L * N;
    - `a`: same as `snapshot.a` (scipy sparse matrices are converted to
    SparseTensors);
    - `e`: same as `snapshot.e`;

    `labels` is the same as `snapshot[t].y`.
    `sample_weights` is the same object passed to the constructor.
